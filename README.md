Artist Mashup
============
Artist Mashup fetch the top-100 ranked artist in Argentina from Last.fm. For each artist it fetch 
its next events and display them in a map. A ranking of artists is rendered using a multi-column layout, where each
artist is depicted using an image that links to a Youtube search for its playlists.

This demo shows:
* connection with Last.fm Social API through https://github.com/fxb/javascript-last.fm-api
* showing artists concerts in a map using LeafletJS http://leafletjs.com/
* modeling a RIA using BackboneJS (http://backbonejs.org/) and Handlebars (http://handlebarsjs.com/)

Issues: we haven't had time to test it in different browsers. Works in Chrome at least.
